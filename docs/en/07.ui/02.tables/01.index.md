# Table Builders

<div class="documentation__toc"></div>

## Introduction

Table builders are responsible for all front-end and control panel tables. They let you easily list model objects.

Typically they are used in conjunction with `streams` but are versatile enough to accommodate API driven/non-model tables as well as fully manual assembly.

### Components

Table components are objects that comprise the table's primary functionality. For example columns, buttons, and actions are all components of table builders.
  
### Definitions

Component `definitions` are basic array or string values that describe the component. The build process takes the component definitions and builds actual classes based on that `input`.

For example the following streams table column could be defined for a table like this:
 
```php
protected $columns = [
    'length',
];
```

Note that only the column slug is needed by default. The rest of the intableation is automated based on the column's stream data.

You can easily override the above column as needed. Let's say you want to suffix the value with `inches`. We can easily change that by overriding the definition:

```php
protected $column = [
    'length' => [
        'value' => '{value} inches',
    ],
];
```
