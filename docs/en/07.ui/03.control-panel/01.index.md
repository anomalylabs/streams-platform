# Control Panel

<div class="documentation__toc"></div>

## Introduction

The control panel builder is responsible for rendering the administrative control panel.

### Components

Control panel components are objects that comprise the CP's primary functionality. For example navigation, sections, and shortcuts are all components of the control panel builder.
  
### Definitions

Component `definitions` are basic array or string values that describe the component. The build process takes the component definitions and builds actual classes based on that `input`.

For example the following addon sections could be defined for the control panel like this:
 
```php
protected $sections = [
    'posts',
    'categories',
];
```

Note that only the section slug is needed by default. The rest of the class is automated based on the section's addon information.

You can easily override the above column as needed. Let's say you want to define an alternate title and a section description:

```php
protected $column = [
    'posts' => [
        'title' => 'Blog Posts',
        'description' => 'Manage your blog articles.',
    ],
    'categories' => [
        'title' => 'Post Categories',
        'description' => 'Manage the categories that posts can appear in.',
    ],
];
```
