## Introduction

The control panel is the admin UI for PyroCMS. It is powered primarily by the `modules` installed.

The building of the control panel is delegated to the `ControlPanelBuilder`.

## Basic Usage

Because much of this process is automated all you need to do is provide a little information in your module and the rest is done for you.

### URI Structure

##### Module URIs

Modules, being the primary building block of the control panel, must be routed by their slug first.
 
    admin/products // Products module
    admin/settings // Settings module

##### Section URIs

The third slug is reserved for `sections`. Each module is divided into sections. The first section, known as the `default section` does not require a URI segment.

    admin/products              // default section of products module
    admin/products/categories   // "categories" section of products module
    admin/products/brands       // "brands" section of products module

<div class="alert alert-info">
<strong>Pro-tip:</strong> An excellent naming convention is to name your products after your primary stream. And your default section after your module and primary stream as well so everything aligns nicely. 
</div>

##### Continuing the URI

After the module section segment the control panel no longer has any interest in your URI pattern without further configuration.

### Module Navigation

Primary module navigation is entirely automated. To get started just make sure that your module has an `addon.title` language key.
 
    File: products-module/resources/lang/en/addon.php
    
    <?php
    
    return [
        'title' => 'Products'
    ];

<a name="section-navigation"></a>
### Section Navigation

Sections are defined in your `Module` class in the `$sections` property. 

    class class UsersModuleSections extends Module
    {
        protected $sections = [
            'users',
            'roles',
            'fields',
        ];
    }

Sections also support `handlers` to dynamically control the sections of your module. To do so use a callable string for your `$sections` property or create a valid handler class next to your module class.

    protected $sections = 'Anomaly\ProductsModule\ProductsModuleSections@handle';

The handler is called from the service container but passed the `$builder`.

    class UsersModuleSections
    {
        public function handle(ControlPanelBuilder $builder)
        {
            $builder->setSections([
                'users',
                'roles',
                'fields',
            ]);
        }
    }

##### Defining additional section information

By default you only need to define a simple string for a section. This string becomes the `slug` of the section and is used in translating it's name.

You can however provide as much information about the section as you want to customize it's behavior.

    protected $sections = [
        'users'  => [
            'slug' => 'users',
            'title' => 'Users',
            'description' => 'The users section',
            'buttons' => [
                'new_user'
            ],
            'icon' => 'icon-reference',
            'class' => 'some-cool-class',
            'matcher' => 'admin/users/*',
            'parent' => 'parent',
            'sections' => [
                'child_sections'
            ],
            'attributes' => 'attributes',
            'href' => 'href',
            'breadcrumb' => 'breadcrumb',
            'permalink' => 'permalink'
        ],
        'roles'  => [
            'buttons' => [
                'new_role'
            ]
        ],
        'fields' => [
            'buttons' => [
                'add_field' => [
                    'data-toggle' => 'modal',
                    'data-target' => '#modal',
                    'href'        => 'admin/users/fields/choose'
                ]
            ]
        ]
    ];

##### The section definition

Below is a list of all possible section definition properties available.

<table class="table table-striped">
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Default/Fallback</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>slug</code> <strong class="text-danger">*</strong></td>
        <td>The section array key</td>
        <td>The slug will become the URI segment and must be unique.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>title</code></td>
        <td>{vendor}.module.{module}::section.{slug}.title</td>
        <td>The section title or translation key.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>description</code></td>
        <td>{vendor}.module.{module}::section.{slug}.description</td>
        <td>The section description or translation key.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>buttons</code></td>
        <td>None</td>
        <td>An array of button definitions.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>icon</code></td>
        <td>None</td>
        <td>A registered icon string or icon class.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>class</code></td>
        <td>None</td>
        <td>A CSS class to append to the section.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>matcher</code></td>
        <td>None</td>
        <td>A string pattern to test against a request path to determine if the section is active or not.<br>Example: <code>admin/products/*/variants</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>parent</code></td>
        <td>None</td>
        <td>The slug of the parent section if any. Sub-sections will not display in the navigation. Sub-sections highlight their parent when active and display their own buttons.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>sections</code></td>
        <td>None</td>
        <td>An array of section definitions. These are placed in the base array and <code>parent</code> set on them automatically.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>attributes</code></td>
        <td>None</td>
        <td>An array of <code>key => value</code> HTML attributes. Any base level definition keys starting with <code>data-</code> will be pushed into attributes automatically.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>href</code></td>
        <td>admin/{module}/{slug}</td>
        <td>The HREF to the section. This gets pushed into <code>attributes</code> automatically.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>breadcrumb</code></td>
        <td>The section title</td>
        <td>The breadcrumb text for the section.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>permalink</code></td>
        <td>None</td>
        <td>The actual permalink for the section in the case that the HREF is used for something different. This is helpful when the HREF used for the section link needs to be different than the actual HREF for the section. Like a section link that opens a modal as in the above example to take you into the section.</td>
    </tr>

### Section Buttons

Section buttons are defined in the section definitions `buttons` property. For more information on button definitions please refer to the button UI documentation.
